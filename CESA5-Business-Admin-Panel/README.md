# CESA 5 - Business Admin Panel (BAP)
 
# Description & Brief Introduction
This program started back in October of 2021, with the initial purpose for a business administrator to verify, compare, and check employee data in an easy-to-use
graphical user interface rather than staring and seraching through spreadsheets to analyze data. Fast-forward to now, and the BAP has expanded to work towards migrating
all business budgeting sheets into a single application.

This program was created by Nicholas Fritsch.
